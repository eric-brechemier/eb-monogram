# Monogram of Eric Bréchemier

I designed this monogram in September 2022 for use as a profile picture,
in online pages and in print documents.

## Rationale

The letters E and B are drawn in a calligraphic hand which I designed
in 2020 part of visual research for the project [Cook 250][]. This project
questions the 2019 celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the first arrival
of James Cook in New Zealand in 1769, opening the door to its rediscovery and
colonization by Europeans.

The tight and strong shapes of this calligraphic hand were inspired by
the typeface [Whakarare][] designed by Māori designer [Johnson Witehira][].
